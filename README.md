# Scala NumberFormatException in Implicit Conversion

This example demonstrates a common error in Scala involving implicit type conversions from String to Int.  When an implicit conversion is used to convert a String to an Int, a `NumberFormatException` can occur if the String does not represent a valid integer.

This issue often arises when dealing with user input or data from external sources where the data may not be well-formed or may contain unexpected values.

The solution involves robust error handling using try-catch blocks to gracefully manage such situations.
